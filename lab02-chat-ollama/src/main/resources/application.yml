# TODO-04: Set the spring.application.name to "Lab02 Chat Ollama" or something similar.
# Set spring.main.web-application-type to none to run as a non-web application.
# Set spring.ai.retry.max-attempts to 1 to fail fast.
# Set spring.ai.retry.on-client-errors to false since there is typically no point in retrying such a request.
# Set spring.ai.model.chat to ollama to tell SpringAI which autoconfigure class to use.
# Set spring.ai.ollama.base-url to http://localhost:11434, unless your container is running on a different URL.
